# CulLang - Speed and Simplicity
CulLang is a open-source programming language to inculcate simplicity with speed.It will be both interpreted and compiled for convenient usage.

# Why to use this?
Whenever I use python, I can feel the simplicity it provides. But on practical usage, the basic features of the language is not used generally as they can be slow. Thus I want to implement a language which can be dynamic and static providing massive performance boost. So to start here we have the features...

# Features
1. Dynamic and static variables (about the type)
2. Manual as well as automatic memory deallocation
3. A interlinker to work with cpp , c , python and other languages
4. Better syntax and some conservative principles 
5. Macros and preprocessors 
6. and others

All this are for now in progress and will be there!

# How to use it now

Well this is too early in prodution and need to be build on your computer.

I'm on Windows and using GNU compiler with C++ (g++17)

Run the exe and enter your file name.
